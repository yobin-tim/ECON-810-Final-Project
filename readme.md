# Final Project 810

## Description

### Human-capital accumulation 
- At any period $t$ agents without a college degree $(z=0)$ decide to attend college or not.
- If they attend college, spend $t+1, \ldots, t+5$ periods earning $0$ and after that get a college degree $(z = 1)$.

### Firm Side
- Two types of firms $H$ and $L$.
- If employed by $I$ draw wage from $F_I$ with $\mathbb{E}[H]>\mathbb{E}[L]$.
- $H$ firm want to hire above certain threshold, fimr $L$ dosen't care.

## Simulation
- Agents start $z=0$.
- Agents start with different initial wealth.
